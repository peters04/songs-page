      [Verse 1]
If all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
      Hey moon, please forget to fall down
      Hey moon, don’t you go down
      Sugarcane in the easy morning
      Weathervanes my one and lonely
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 2]
      The ink is running toward the page, it’s chasing off the days
      Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
      I missed your skin when you were east
      You clicked your heels and wished for me
      Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
      Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
      I know the world’s a broken bone
      But melt your headaches, call it home
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
      Hey moon, please forget to fall down
      Hey moon, don’t you go down
      Sugarcane in the easy morning
      Weathervanes my one and lonely
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Bridge]
      Sugarcane in the easy morning
      Weathervanes my one and lonely
      Sugarcane in the easy morning
      Weathervanes my one and lonely

      <br>
      <br>

      Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
      Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)
      Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
      Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)

      <br>
      <br>

      Sugarcane in the easy morning
      (Hey moon, please forget to fall down)
      Weathervanes my one and lonely
      (Hey moon, don't you go down)
      Sugarcane in the easy morning
      (You are at the top of my lungs)
      Weathervanes my one and lonely
      (Drawn to the ones who never yawn)

      <br>
      <br>

      Sugarcane in the easy morning
      (Hey moon, please forget to fall down)
      Weathervanes my one and lonely
      (Hey moon, don't you go down)
      You are at the top of my lungs
      Drawn to the ones who never yawn
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Pre-Chorus]
      So come bring on all that you've got
      Come hell, come high water, never stop
      Unless you are 40 to 1
      Your lives will soon be undone
      UNDONE!
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      Hey moon, please forget to fall down
      Hey moon, don't you go down
      You are at the top of my lungs
