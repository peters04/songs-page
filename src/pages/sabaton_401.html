      [Intro]
      Baptised in fire
      40:1
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 1]
      So silent before the storm, awaiting command
      A few has been chosen to stand
      As one outnumbered by far
      The orders from high command:
      Fight back, hold your ground!
      In early September it came
      A war unknown to the world
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Pre-Chorus]
      No army may enter that land
      That is protected by Polish hand
      Unless you are 40 to 1
      Your force will soon be undone
      UNDONE!
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
      Baptised in fire
      40:1
      Spirit of Spartans
      Death and glory
      Soldiers of Poland
      Second to none
      Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 2]
      The 8th of September it starts
      The rage of the Reich
      A barrage of mortars and guns
      Stand fast, the bunkers will hold
      The captain has pledged his life
      "I'll face my fate here!"
      The sound of artillery strike
      So fierce the thunder of guns
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Pre-Chorus]
      So come bring on all that you've got
      Come hell, come high water, never stop
      Unless you are 40 to 1
      Your lives will soon be undone
      UNDONE!
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
      Baptised in fire
      40 to 1
      Spirit of Spartans
      Death and glory
      Soldiers of Poland
      Second to none
      Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Bridge]
      Always remember, a fallen soldier
      Always remember, fathers and sons at war
      Always remember, a fallen soldier
      Always remember, fathers and sons at war
      Always remember, a fallen soldier
      Always remember, buried in history
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Pre-Chorus]
      No vermin may enter that land
      That is protected by Polish hand
      Unless you are 40 to 1
      Your force will soon be undone
      UNDONE!
