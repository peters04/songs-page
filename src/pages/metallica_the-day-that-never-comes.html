      [Instrumental Intro]

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 1]
Born to push you 'round
Better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting

    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
      Waiting for the one
      The day that never comes
      When you stand up and feel the warmth
      But the son shine never comes, no
      No, the son shine never comes
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      Push you cross that line
      Just stay down this time
      Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
      God, I'll make them pay
      Take it back one day
      I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no

    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Bridge]
      Love is a four letter word
      And never spoken here
      Love is a four letter word
      Here in this prison
      I suffer this no longer
      I'll put an end to this, I swear
      This, I swear, the son will shine
      This, I swear! This, I swear!
      This! I! Swear!
