      [Chorus]
Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
[Verse 1]
Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself
Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
      Good day, how do?
      And I send a smile to you
      Don't waste, waste your breath
      And I won't waste my hate on you
      Waste my hate on you
      Hate
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 2]
You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?
Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself, hey!
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 3]
Ain't gonna waste my hate
But I'm so greedy when they say
Better to give than to receive
Ain't gonna waste my hate, no, no
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you
Yeah, I think I'm going to keep it all for myself
For myself
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself, yeah!
Hate
