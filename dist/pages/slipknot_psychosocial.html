      [Intro: Corey Taylor]
Ooh, yeah
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus: Corey Taylor]
      And the rain will kill us all
      Throw ourselves against the wall
      But no one else can see
      The preservation of the martyr in me
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      Push you cross that line
      Just stay down this time
      Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
      God, I'll make them pay
      Take it back one day
      I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Post-Chorus: Clown, Chris Fehn, & Paul Gray]
      Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
      Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
      There are cracks in the road we laid
      But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
      This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
      The hate was all we had
      Who needs another mess? We could start over
      Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
      Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
      I think we're done, I'm not the only one
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus: Corey Taylor]
And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me
    </p>
    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Post-Chorus: Clown, Chris Fehn, & Paul Gray]
      Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
      Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

[Bridge: Corey Taylor, Clown, Chris Fehn, & Paul Gray]
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 3: Corey Taylor]
Fake anti-fascist lie (Psychosocial)
I tried to tell you, but (Psychosocial)
Your purple hearts are giving out! (Psychosocial)
Can't stop a killing idea (Psychosocial)
If it's hunting season (Psychosocial)
Is this what you want? (Psychosocial)
I'm not the only one
    </p>

      [Chorus: Corey Taylor]
