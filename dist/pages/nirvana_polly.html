      [Verse 1]
      Polly wants a cracker
      I think I should get off her first
      I think she wants some water
      To put out the blow torch
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 2]
      Polly wants a cracker
      Maybe she would like some food
      She asked me to untie her
      A chase would be nice for a few
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
      Isn't me, have a seed
      Let me clip your dirty wings
      Let me take a ride, cut yourself
      Want some help, please myself
      Got some rope, have been told
      Promise you, have been true
      Let me take a ride, cut yourself
      Want some help, please myself
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Verse 3]
      Polly said
      Polly says her back hurts
      She's just as bored as me
      She caught me off my guard
      Amazes me the will of instinct
    </p>

    <p class="c-lyrics__verse">
      [Chorus]
      Isn't me, have a seed
      Let me clip your dirty wings
      Let me take a ride, cut yourself
      Want some help, please myself
      Got some rope, have been told
      Promise you, have been true
      Let me take a ride, cut yourself
      Want some help, please myself
